<h3 align="center"> Oh, hi there, friend 👋 </h3>
<p align="center">I wonder how on earth you found this page. Anyway.</p>

### Who am I? 
I wonder the same thing. I mostly write code (usuprisingly), yet that is not the only hobby of mine.

I live and study in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Quite a nice city, housing the greatest IT university in all of Ukraine - National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.

### Ama back-end engineer ⌨️
I do some amount of server stuff. Working with API techologies like <img height="18" src="assets/graphql.svg" />, <img height="18" src="assets/grpc.png" />, and <img height="18" src="assets/openapi.svg" /> for providing specification of REST APIs. Proefficient with tools like <img height="18" src="assets/docker.svg" />, familiar with <img height="18" src="assets/kubernetes.svg" />. Set up CI/CD using <img height="18" src="assets/ghactions.svg" />.

Written applications with <img height="18" src="assets/nodejs.svg" /> using <img height="18" src="assets/typescript.svg" />, <img height="18" src="assets/rust.svg" />, and <img height="18" src="assets/kotlin.svg" />

Deployed services on <img height="18" src="assets/aws.svg" /> and <img height="18" src="assets/gcp.svg" />, using services like EC2, S3, RDS, SNS and Lambda (or GCP alternatives).

### Ama front-end engineer 🖥
I've been writing web applications using <img height="18" src="assets/react.svg" /> for a long while now, and simpler applications using plaing <img height="18" src="assets/html.svg" />, <img height="18" src="assets/javascript.svg" /> and <img height="18" src="assets/css.svg" /> for even longer. Yet nowadays I prefer using <img height="18" src="assets/typescript.svg" /> over <img height="18" src="assets/javascript.svg" />, <img height="18" src="assets/sass.svg" /> over <img height="18" src="assets/css.svg" />, and <img height="18" src="assets/yarn.svg" /> over <img height="18" src="assets/npm.svg" />. For the years being I've grown quite fond of Reacts simplicity and flexibility.

### I'm a low-level geek 🤓
I really enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of things, diving deep down into specifics. I dunno, computer sience is astonishing sometimes. Thats why I enjoy writing <img height="18" src="assets/cpp.svg" />, and now <img height="18" src="assets/rust.svg" />. Diving into low-level stuff, composing zero-level abstractions in an efficient way using compile-time constructs: yeah, that's my jam. _Sometimes though, I can get frustrated by rarely-encountered segfaults or data-races, but C++'s newer abstractions and rust in the whole have been lately kind to me in that regard_

This CS amusement also drives me to learn new concepts. Like diving deeper into the pure functional world of <img height="18" src="assets/haskell.svg" />, like I've been doing lately. Also, I'm looking forward to learning logical paradigm of Prolog as a part of my university curriculum.

I really like expressing my creativity through visual media. Be it photos, or films (films to a much lesser extent nowadays). 

You can follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/q_link0_p/)

(_Yes, that's the profile pic_)

### I'm sociable animal 🐝
I like hangin' 'round like minded people. Unfourtunately COVID wasn't great in that regard 😷. I need cooperation like air. Just put me in team environment to let me be happy.

Also I like snowboarding 🏂, but I has been a real while since I stepped onto the board

### What's on my mind right now? 🧠
I want to help out a friend to make his pet-project, meanwhile learning rust and gaining experience in back-end stuff.
Want to make some personal rig upgrades (I really need a new desk).
Looking forward to writing some iOS apps.

### My TODO list 📝
- [X] Finish reading "Programming in Haskell"
- [X] Write something in Rust
- [ ] Play with SwiftUI
- [ ] Start a new academic year at uni
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Do something meaningful

### Bit of stats 📊
They are not that representative, as I use GitHub organisations to namespace projects of me and my friends. So techincally I do not contribute to my own projects. Nevertheless checkout [motum](https://github.com/MotumInc) and [ne-student](https://github.com/Ne-Student) organisations, they contain a heafty bit of my work.
